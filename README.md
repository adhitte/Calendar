## Calendar Desktop Application
  A simple desktop calendar app built with **Python** and **PyQt5**.
  This is my very first desktop app project and was created as a beginner friendly exploration of GUI environment in Python

---

## Features
  - Displays a calendar widget with clickable dates
  - Shows the selected date in a label below the calendar
  - Built using PyQt5 for cross-platform desktop support
  - Lightweight and easy to run

---

## Project Structure
  calendar_app -> main project folder
  main.py -> starts the app
  calendar_ui.py -> contains code for calendar widget
  requirements.txt -> lists dependancies

---

## Installation and Setup
  1. **Download your repo**
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar.git
         *(creates local copy of your repo on your computer)*
  2. **Go into the repo folder**
       cd calendar
         *(This switches your terminal into that folder so you can run files there)*
  3. **Install Dependancies**
       pip install -r requirements.txt
         *(Installs all the libraries written in requirements.txt)*
  4. **Run the app**
       python main.py
         *(runs the file in which the main code is written)*

---

## Requirements
  1. Python 3.8+
  2. PyQt5

## Future Improvements
  - Add custom stylesheets for a more colorful design
  - Include graphics or icons for navigation
  - Event management i.e. add notes/reminders to specific dates
