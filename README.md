## Calendar Desktop Application
  A simple desktop calendar app built with **Python** and **PyQt5**.
  This is my very first desktop app project and was created as a beginner friendly exploration of GUI environment in Python

---

## Features
  - Displays a calendar widget with clickable dates<br>
  - Shows the selected date in a label below the calendar<br>
  - Built using PyQt5 for cross-platform desktop support<br>
  - Lightweight and easy to run<br>

---

## Project Structure
  calendar_app -> *main project folder* <br>
  main.py -> *starts the app* <br>
  calendar_ui.py -> *contains code for calendar widget* <br>
  requirements.txt -> *lists dependancies* <br>

---

## Installation and Setup
  1. **Download your repo**<br>
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar.git<br>
         *(creates local copy of your repo on your computer)* <br>
  2. **Go into the repo folder**<br>
       cd calendar<br>
         *(This switches your terminal into that folder so you can run files there)* <br>
  3. **Install Dependancies**<br>
       pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
         *(Installs all the libraries written in requirements.txt)* <br>
  4. **Run the app**<br>
       python main.py<br>
         *(runs the file in which the main code is written)* <br>

## Requirements
  1. Python 3.8+<br>
  2. PyQt5<br>

## Future Improvements
  - Add custom stylesheets for a more colorful design<br>
  - Include graphics or icons for navigation<br>
  - Event management i.e. add notes/reminders to specific dates<br>
